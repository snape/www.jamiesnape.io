## Abstract

The theory of elliptic functions offers abundant applications in arithmetic,
dynamics, and even probability and statistics. Yet often overlooked is the
significance of these functions within classical and algebraic geometry. This
dissertation illustrates uses of the Jacobi and Weierstrass functions, taking
motivation from the geometric path drawn by a swinging pendulum. Applications
develop from the classical works of Gauss, Euler, and Fagnano on the
rectification of the lemniscate and ellipse, through Poncelet's poristic
polygons and Seiffert's spherical spiral, to modern day elliptic curve
cryptography inspired by the work of Abel. The lesser-known nine circles theorem
forms the conclusion, demonstrating the power of elliptic functions in
simplifying complex proofs of elementary geometry.
